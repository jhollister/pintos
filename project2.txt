---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or

-- The structure has not been written, thus we don't have a declaration yet.
Ideally our structure will have a pointer to the children and a pointer to the parent processes, 
so that when we wait we can notify the parent when the child finished and if we are to exit , we need to 
know what children to wait for.

typedef MAX_ARGS = 3
Define a limit to the arguments passed given to comply with implementation examples

>> B2: Describe how file descriptors are associated with open files.
>> Are file descriptors unique within the entire OS or just within a
>> single process?

File descriptors are unique within a process. If a child is created, then the files are inhereted from the parent
but the file descriptors must still be unique. If not , communication will be ambigious, ie. input will be shared
which is not what we need. The openfiles are referenced through the file descriptor, but again if 2 threads are writing
we will have race conditions as to where new data will be placed, through they will complete entirely.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: Describe your code for reading and writing user data from the
>> kernel.

writing: code was provided:
Without loss of generality, the processes are very similar and will only explain one.

First we get a list of arguments, then we check to see of the buffer is valid. We then get a pointer to our file. From 
here we check if the file descriptor actually points to a valid file with proper permissions and start writing to 
the file based on our checks. Before we actually write to the file we will need to obtain a lock so avoid any 
race condition or access issues.

--------------------------------------------------------

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B7: The "exec" system call returns -1 if loading the new executable
>> fails, so it cannot return before the new executable has completed
>> loading.  How does your code ensure this?  How is the load
>> success/failure status passed back to the thread that calls "exec"?

>> B8: Consider parent process P with child process C.  How do you
>> ensure proper synchronization and avoid race conditions when P
>> calls wait(C) before C exits?  After C exits?  How do you ensure
>> that all resources are freed in each case?  How about when P
>> terminates without waiting, before C exits?  After C exits?  Are
>> there any special cases?

---- RATIONALE ----

>> B9: Why did you choose to implement access to user memory from the
>> kernel in the way that you did?

>> B10: What advantages or disadvantages can you see to your design
>> for file descriptors?

>> B11: The default tid_t to pid_t mapping is the identity mapping.
>> If you changed it, what advantages are there to your approach?

			   SURVEY QUESTIONS
			   ================

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future quarters.  Feel free to tell us anything you
want--these questions are just to spur your thoughts.  You may also
choose to respond anonymously in the course evaluations at the end of
the quarter.

>> Is there some particular fact or hint we should give students in
