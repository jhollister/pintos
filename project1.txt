static struct list sleep_list;
/*
The list structure was required to keep track of sleeping threads , without utilizing the cpu 
using the busy wait as previously implemented. 
*/

struct thread
{
...
int64_t awakeTime;                  /* Time to awake thread if sleeping */
struct list_elem sleepelem;         /* List element for sleeping list */
...
}
/*
Added awake_time which holds the amount of ticks that would need to have occured in order 
for the thread  to wake up if it was sleeping.
Added sleepelem that is needed for the sleep list above.
*/

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe what happens in a call to timer_sleep(),
>> including the effects of the timer interrupt handler.

First we save the current interrupt status

Then we set the current threads awake time to equal the current ticks
plus the ticks given as a parameter to the function call.

Then we disble interrups so that the we can have exclusive access to the list elements.

Then we do a sorted insert , where the sorting is based on the awake time , from high to low.

Then we block the thread.

Then re-set interrupts to the original level.

>> A3: What steps are taken to minimize the amount of time spent in
>> the timer interrupt handler?

Since we have a sorted list based on the sorted insertions, we just need to check the top most elements of our
list to see if we need to awake the thread, rather then checking the entire list for the same check.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> A4: How are race conditions avoided when multiple threads call
>> timer_sleep() simultaneously?

Through the use of system interrupts , we disable the context switcihing by disabling interrupts we accessing the 
shared resource sleeplist. Once we are done using the shared resource, we enable to the previous state.

>> A5: How are race conditions avoided when a timer interrupt occurs
>> during a call to timer_sleep()?

By obtaining our sorting element timer_ticks() and inserting into our sleep list when interrupts are diabled, 
we ensure that we don't have race condition about our shared resources.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A6: Why did you choose this design?  In what ways is it superior to
>> another design you considered?

We chose to implent using sorted insert because that would have a runtime of O(n) when inserting, 
but would allow for constant access time for the next element we need to access.

Another possible implementation was to insert unsorted , which would be a constant time insert, 
but O(n) access time. But we need to access elements at every tick, giving us a less efficient implementation.

			 PRIORITY SCHEDULING
			 ===================

>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

>> B2: Explain the data structure used to track priority donation.

>> .png file.)

SEE ATTACHED PNG

The attached image shows our structure implementation to realize the priority scheduler.

First, our thread structure will have a list of pointers to locks that it is holding.
Note: Only running threads can be lock holders, threads waiting on a lock are not considered lock holders.

Using the list of lock pointers, we can reference the waiting threads of the lock to determine the maximum priority 
that can be donated and see whats greater , the currently set priority or the donated priority. Although we will 
not change the priority of the running proccess, we will have a reference to this higher donated priority.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: How do you ensure that the highest priority thread waiting for
>> a lock, semaphore, or condition variable wakes up first?

The locking structure has a list of waiting threads, and we extract the thread with the highest priority, 
including donated priority.

>> B4: Describe the sequence of events when a call to lock_acquire()
>> causes a priority donation.  How is nested donation handled?

//

>> B5: Describe the sequence of events when lock_release() is called
>> on a lock that a higher-priority thread is waiting for.

			   SURVEY QUESTIONS
			   ================

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future quarters.  Feel free to tell us anything you
want--these questions are just to spur your thoughts.  You may also
choose to respond anonymously in the course evaluations at the end of
the quarter.

>> In your opinion, was this assignment, or any one of the three problems
>> in it, too easy or too hard?  Did it take too long or too little time?

We haven't finished the project yet so we don't know if it took too long. The complexity of this 
project is understanding the syntax , combined with new concept implementation.  So far this seems managable.

>> Did you find that working on a particular part of the assignment gave
>> you greater insight into some aspect of OS design?

Learning theory is great, but theory implementation gives further insight into the concepts as one must
think about implementation issues that arise and the associated solutions.

>> Is there some particular fact or hint we should give students in
>> future quarters to help them solve the problems?  Conversely, did you
>> find any of our guidance to be misleading?

The guidance from the TA was very leading and helped our team focus on the implementation, instead of 
spending time finding the focus area. We still had to think of the solution so this help was great.

>> Do you have any suggestions for the TAs to more effectively assist
>> students, either for future quarters or the remaining projects?

Clear guidance as was given in project 1 will help with the subsequent projects. So far the guidance has been on point.

>> Any other comments?
