  exec_helper shares data between process_execute, thread_create and process_start.

In setup_stack() we call setup_stack_helper() where we will call strtok_r with a space
as a delimiter. We store each of these tokens in an array and increase our argc at the same time.
When we push these tokens onto the stack we start from argc-1 until we get to 0, pushing each pointer
onto the stack. This way, we will get each element of argv[] to be in the right order.
To avoid overflowing the stack page we limited the size of the total arguments to be less than
one page size (4 KB).


---- RATIONALE ----

>> A3: Why does Pintos implement strtok_r() but not strtok()?

strtok_r() is reentrant so it can be called from multiple threads without causing undefined behavior.
It can also be used to parse multiple strings at once.

The unix approach means less unnecessary work done at the kernel level.
The unix approach may allow for better error handling at the user level instead of kernel level.

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

The structures has not been written, thus we don't have a declarations yet.
Ideally our structure will have a pointer to the children and a pointer to the parent processes, 
so that when we wait we can notify the parent when the child finished and if we are to exit , we need to 
know what children to wait for.

MORE WORK NEEDED TO ANSWER ACCURATELY.

>> B2: Describe how file descriptors are associated with open files.
>> Are file descriptors unique within the entire OS or just within a
>> single process?

File descriptors are unique within a process. If a child is created, then the files are inhereted from the parent
but the file descriptors must still be unique. If not , communication will be ambigious, ie. input will be shared
which is not what we need. The openfiles are referenced through the file descriptor, but again if 2 threads are writing
we will have race conditions as to where new data will be placed, through they will complete entirely.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: Describe your code for reading and writing user data from the
>> kernel.

writing: code was provided:
Without loss of generality, the processes are very similar and will only explain one.

First we get a list of arguments, then we check to see of the buffer is valid. We then get a pointer to our file. From 
here we check if the file descriptor actually points to a valid file with proper permissions and start writing to 
the file based on our checks. Before we actually write to the file we will need to obtain a lock so avoid any 
race condition or access issues.

If the user space data spans over two pages then it would take max 2 calls to pagedir_get_page
because it may be held over two pages. If it's all on one page then it would take 1 call to
pagedir_get_page.
Two bytes would have the same result as 4,096 bytes (although much more likely to only require 1).
There's no way to avoid the second lookup so this can not be improved.

>> B5: Briefly describe your implementation of the "wait" system call
>> and how it interacts with process termination.

The wait system call will look at the list of children processes and using the 
synchronization structures (lock and semaphore), will wait for the children 
to finish until there are no more children to wait on. Process termination will set the 
children status so that we know whether to wait for a child or not.

We separate each level and function so that they are all responsible for their own 
resources. If an error occurs inside of a function it will then clean up all resources
it has allocated and return an error value so that the function above it can do the same.

This requires us to make sure that every function call is checked for an error return value
if it has a possibility of going wrong and that every function has an error handling section.


---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B7: The "exec" system call returns -1 if loading the new executable
>> fails, so it cannot return before the new executable has completed
>> loading.  How does your code ensure this?  How is the load
>> success/failure status passed back to the thread that calls "exec"?

To exec, we first need to create a child process. Once this process exists, we will try to load
a new process. If the load is successfull, we will set the load_status variable in the process 
structure to true(0) or false(-1). When we return from the load, we will return the load status of the struct.

>> B8: Consider parent process P with child process C.  How do you

>> terminates without waiting, before C exits?  After C exits?  Are
>> there any special cases?

Part of the creating process adds C to the child process of P and P to the parent list of C.
Doing so ensures that if the child executes first and completes, the parent will know that the child 
terminated and will not wait. Else if the child exists, the parent will effectively wait for child.

In the converse situation with the parent terminating before the child, we will set the parent pointer 
to all the children of the parent to null.

Given both cases, the race condition can occur without adverse affects.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> B9: Why did you choose to implement access to user memory from the
>> kernel in the way that you did?

WE HAVE NOT IMPLEMENTED YET.
But the answer to this is similar to the answer to B6.
We chose to compartmentalize our code so that each function works within its 
execution mode and handles it's own resources. This will force each function 
to have it's own error checking and as a consequence it will allow for better error 
checking due to the limited scope of the functions.

>> B10: What advantages or disadvantages can you see to your design
>> for file descriptors?

We have 2 solutions for this implementations.

1) Use a fd counter, with 2 lists . One for the fd's in use and the other for the closed fd's
this will allow us not to search for the next available fd, but will add to the memory requirements.

2) Use a predefined array with booleans to signify whether the fd is in use. this will also require memory, 
but will have a smaller overhead.

Given that this is not a server where many fd's are expected, we will implement with option 2. If we tried to 
minimize memory consumption would use an implementation similar the the first.

>> B11: The default tid_t to pid_t mapping is the identity mapping.
>> If you changed it, what advantages are there to your approach?

Each process will have one thread, this this is a one to one mapping.
If we had a multicore CPU -> more that 1 thread per process, then this implementaion 
will not be ideal.

			   SURVEY QUESTIONS
			   ================

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future quarters.  Feel free to tell us anything you
want--these questions are just to spur your thoughts.  You may also
choose to respond anonymously in the course evaluations at the end of
the quarter.

>> In your opinion, was this assignment, or any one of the three problems

Clarity of the assignment. Example was the interaction between system calls and the 
handler. 

>> Did you find that working on a particular part of the assignment gave
>> you greater insight into some aspect of OS design?

System calls helped with concreting the concepts of priviledge execution modes.
The project as a whole helped with memory implementation.

Clearer references to the helper functions and or assertions that would have helped for implementation.
